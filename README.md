Veenna San Felipe's Personal Website

I designed this website using only HTML and CSS. I'm currently learning JavaScript and will gradually
incorporate what I learn (where applicable). My main goal with this website was to practice the skills I've learned from
Codecademy's Front-end Engineer Career Path. However, now I'm using this website as a portfolio to showcase my projects
and artwork all in one place.

The main challenge I constantly have in setting up this website is implementing flexbox. It's a topic I had trouble
learning and I want to get it down. I also aim for my website to be responsive, and I believe utilizing this kind of layout
is perfect for that.

Tools used: Sublime Text and prepos.io
